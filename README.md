# OpenStardrive Server

This is the server component for the OpenStardrive simulation software.
It runs on [.NET Core 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0).


## Running the Server

To run the server locally:

```
cd OpenStardriveServer
dotnet run
```

Once the server is running, you can connect clients to interact with it.
The [dev-client](./dev-client/README.md) directory contains an example client used during development
of the software.
