# Dev Client

This directory contains a very simple client used to interact with the server 
during development.

It is not intended to be a "full featured" client capable of every interaction
with a polished user interface.
Instead, its purposes are to:
* provide a simple way to interact with the server
* render data into a relatively easy-to-read format
* enable quick development and experimentation
  (e.g. "Will this system idea work?")
* demonstrate what the server does
* be an example of the core concepts needed to build another client


## Using the Dev Client

When the server is running, open `index.html` in a web browser.
